# Start Here

Any new stack can be a little overwhelming at first glance. Where do you start!? Well, with Freya, you can start here. The best place to begin is the [Overview of the Freya stack][stack-overview] which gives a high level look at how Freya is structured and which parts do what.

The Stack Overview links to guides and references for each of the individual components of the Freya stack, but we'd recommend looking at one or two of the tutorials before diving in to the guides. Although the tutorials might require a look through the guides to get a full understanding of what's going on under the hood, they should provide a useful flavour of what working with Freya at a high level is like -- hopefully that should inspire you to learn more!

We'd recommend starting with the [TodoBackend tutorial][todobackend] to begin -- it touches on most of the components available with Freya.
